1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	A list of Dogs
	3 Dog objects
	A comparator object

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	The constructor call: new Comparator<Animal>()
	We import the definition with import java.util.Comparator;
		Then we override the compare() method for our purposes.
